# Second Portfolio Theme

### Objective

With this project I will be using learned API and AJAX to communicate with an API. We will use it to improve Code Institute's Rosie resume site. 
I will then personalise this resume site using Code Institute's template.

- Interactive data-driven sites are more engaging for the user.
- Adding a custom map to Rosie's resume site using the Google Maps API.
- We're then going to link an email service so that the candidate will receive an email when somebody fills out the contact form.
- We'll use the GitHub API to showcase her portfolio by linking to the candidate's GitHub repositories.

### Main languages/frameworks used for this project are: 

- JavaScript
- jQuery, both to manipulate the DOM and to make Ajax calls to the Google Maps, GitHub, and email service APIs.
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
